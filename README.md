Benchmarking tests were carried out using Node JS Autocannon. Please see https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon

These tests can be carried out on the command line with the code below

autocannon -c 100 -p 1 -d 5 https://nodejs-rest-cart-api.herokuapp.com

On the concurrency web version, increasing the pipelines from 1 higher sometimes causes an Internal Server Error. The command line can be a fall back option.
